# Diary of work progress

- fixed bug with LaTeX Charles university template
  - use pdfLaTeX instead -> the problem was to stop using ps2pdf package
  - in order to do so, I needed to convert logo.eps to logo.pdf using epstopdf command

- copied important sections of Graph Coloring Problems Book from National Library
- realized that coloring G with k-colors is the same as finding a homomorphism from G to K_k graph

- found a webpage for visualizing the polyhedra: [link](https://polyhedra.tessera.li/)
  - it also has nice definitions for the polyhedra
  - also, I can use the .json objects to get the graph representations for free
- found out how are archimedean solids defined
  - based on operation done on platonic solids
- edited wikipedia page [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_(geometry))

- emailed C++ tutor about graph editor program

- written first draft of the Introduction chapter of the thesis

- drawn pictures of how the operation on Platonic solids behave
  - noted how these operations change the vertex configuration
