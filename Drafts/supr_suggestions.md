The concept of coloring is in mathematical sense equivalent to the concept
of mapping, when the domain — the set of colors — is usually a finite set
without any further structure. So the only relevant characteristic is, whether
two elements are mapped on the same target, or to phrase less colloquially:
colored by the same color.
Hence we may without loss of generality assume that the domain is a set of
positive integers, however sometimes we use usual colors like red, blue, etc, to
visualize some particular colorings in more accessible way.
