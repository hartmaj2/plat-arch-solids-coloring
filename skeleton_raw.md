# Skeleton of the paper

## Motivation

- how platonic solids motivated Greeks & Kepler
- why should they be studied

- fullerenes [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullerene)

## Definitions

solids:
- platonic solids
- archimedean solids

colorings:
- total coloring 
  - [link1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_coloring)
  - [link2](https://utoronto.scholaris.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/25c240a9-2e5f-49ca-a19d-6e9f8cf1ed7f/content)
- magic labeling
- distance constrained coloring

## Graphs of the solids

- Schlegel diagrams (1886) [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlegel_diagram)

- platonic graphs
  - [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedral_graph#Special_cases)
- archimedean graphs [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_graph)
- show proof why there is no more than 5
