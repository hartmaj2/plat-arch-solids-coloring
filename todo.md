# TODOs for bachelor thesis

## 2024_12_10

- [x] look at how other bachelor theses look
  - [x] how is abstract written
  - [x] how are definitions written
  - [x] what are the creative parts

## 2025_02_13

- [x] review all work done so far
- [ ] write definitions of colorings
- [x] look for picture visualisations of operations on platonic solids 
  - truncation, rectification, expansion, snub

## Main tasks

- [ ] find nice visualisation for snub operation
- [ ] write definitions of colorings

## Side tasks

- [ ] build intuition about why there is only five platonic solids proof
  - then read [this](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27961672?seq=1)
- [ ] create own visualisations of the operations using 3d software (Blender)
  - maybe use [this page](https://drajmarsh.bitbucket.io/poly3d.html)
    - read about conway notation
- [ ] suggest tessera.lis:
  - to offer a cantellating view on expansion operation (the size of the polyhedron will decrease)
  - offer chamfer operation
