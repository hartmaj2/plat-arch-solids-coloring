# TODOs for bachelor thesis

## 2024_12_10

- [x] look at how other bachelor theses look
  - [x] how is abstract written
  - [x] how are definitions written
  - [x] what are the creative parts

## 2025_02_13

- [x] review all work done so far
- [ ] write definitions of colorings
- [x] look for picture visualisations of operations on platonic solids 
  - truncation, rectification, expansion, snub

## 2025_02_16

- [x] define other colorings and add examples on cubic graph / or octahedral graph
- [x] define total coloring and add example

### 2025_02_17

- [x] prepare questions to ask supervisor
- [x] sum up what I did since last meeting
- [x] put table with vtx and edge chromatic nums to the thesis

- [x] add source to figures from Wikipedia
- [x] fix definition wordings
  - use inline definition and tag
- [ ] Share overleaf link with supervisor + github repo link
- [ ] implement colorings using layers in Ipe


## Main tasks

- [ ] write definition of chromatic polynomial

## Side tasks

- [ ] find nice visualisation for snub operation

- [ ] build intuition about why there is only five platonic solids proof
  - then read [this](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27961672?seq=1)
