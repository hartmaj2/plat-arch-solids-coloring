# TODOs for bachelor thesis

## 2024_12_10

- [x] look at how other bachelor theses look
  - [x] how is abstract written
  - [x] how are definitions written
  - [x] what are the creative parts

## 2025_02_13

- [x] review all work done so far
- [ ] write definitions of colorings
- [x] look for picture visualisations of operations on platonic solids 
  - truncation, rectification, expansion, snub

## 2025_02_16

- [x] define other colorings and add examples on cubic graph / or octahedral graph
- [x] define total coloring and add example

### 2025_02_17

- [x] prepare questions to ask supervisor
- [x] sum up what I did since last meeting
- [x] put table with vtx and edge chromatic nums to the thesis

- [x] add source to figures from Wikipedia
- [x] fix definition wordings
  - use inline definition and tag
- [x] Share overleaf link with supervisor + github repo link
- [ ] implement colorings using layers in Ipe

### 2025_02_20

- [x] write definition of chromatic polynomial
- [ ] find out how hard it is to find a formula of chromatic polynomial in general
  - what are some methods to calculate by hand?
  - read the definition inside "Chromatic Graph Theory" book

- [ ] consider, how the number of colorings of tetrahedral graph changes (the chromatic polynomial) when taking difference only up to symmetries
- [ ] what does it mean for colorings to be different up to symmetries?

### 2025_02_21

- [x] check what could be useful from KG 2 on MFF 
  - maybe some chromatic polynomial theory?

- [x] calculate chromatic polynomials of platonic solids

### 2025_02_22

- [x] calculate chrom polys of polyhedra for which it runs in reasonable time (i.e. under a minute or so)

- [ ] read about different coloring types from resource sent by supervisor
  - [ ] Strong Edge Coloring of Graph
  - [ ] Vertex Distinguishing Total Coloring
  - [ ] Acyclic Coloring
  - [ ] List Coloring
  - [ ] π-Coloring and Incident Vertex π-Coloring

- [x] fix the general definition of colorings

## 2025_02_24

- [x] add paragraph about all Platonic and Archimedean solids being in Vizing class one (show degrees of the graphs in the table as well)

## 2025_03_01

- [ ] read about different coloring types where value of color matters
  - [ ] rainbow coloring (more to do with connectivity of graph, the value does not actually matter)
  - [ ] magic labeling

- [ ] write definitions of the colorings above and add example figures

## Main tasks

- [ ] what do operations on the Platonic solids do on the graphs?

- [ ] how to convert special colorings to vertex coloring by transforming the graph to a different graph
  - [ ] describe and add figures to visualize
  - [ ] implement in python and compute the chromatic numbers for these colorings

## Side tasks

- [ ] add black borders to figures with colored vertices

- [ ] read useful resources found on 19.2.2025

- [ ] find nice visualisation for snub operation

- [ ] animate polyhedra operations in blender

- [ ] why the construction for Platonic solids below works (why after construction, the graph can't be still in class one?):
  - "In contrast, he observed that for any maximum degree in the range from two to five, there exist planar graphs of class two. For degree two, any odd cycle is such a graph, and for degree three, four, and five, these graphs can be constructed from platonic solids by replacing a single edge by a path of two adjacent edges."
