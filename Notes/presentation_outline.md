# Outline of topics I want to cover in the presentation

## Introduction

- what are the objects that my thesis investigates?
- what was the main goal of the thesis?

## Slides outline

1. What are platonic and archimedean solids?
   - definition + examples (pictures)
2. Various types of coloring
   - argument why we show them
   - visualisations
3. Chromatic polynomial
   -  definition + recursive formula
4. Formula for chromatic polynomial of complete k-partite graphs with partite size 2
   - show the formula + visualization
   - don't go into the details of the proof
5. Orbital chromatic polynomial
   - definition of transitivity relation (exists automorphism which preserves colors, rotation)
   - definition + algorithm for computing it
6. Counting partitions into independent sets instead of all colorings
   - define relabeling relation
7. Counting independent sets up to automorphisms

## Latex formulas to use

For a graph $G$ the chromatic polynomial is denoted $P(G,x)$
