# List of relevant chapters or pages from Graph Coloring Problems book

- p.2 - def of homomorphism, def of k-coloring using homomorphism to K_k graph
- p.5 - definition of chromatic polynomial
- p.6 - Heawood[1898] - characterisation of 3-colorable plane triangulations (they are exactly those with even degrees of all vertices)
- p.7 - Grotzsch[1959] - necessary condition of triangle free graphs (they must be 3-colorable)
- p.7 - Brooks[1941] - characterisation of graphs s.t. $\chi(G) = \Delta(G) + 1$ (characterisation based on two cases - the only interesting for platonic and archimedean graphs are the ones where $\Delta(G) \neq 2$)
- p.9, thm 14 - Konig[1916] - characterization of 2-colorable graphs
- p.16, thm. 26 - Tait[1880] - connection between coloring of faces and edges of plane graph of 3-regular graphs
- p. 86 - Total coloring definition
- p. 193, 12.7 - Vizing's Planar Graph Conjecture (what Vizing class planar graphs of certain degrees belong to)
