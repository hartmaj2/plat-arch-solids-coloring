## Questions

- Do I have to provide argument why the 3d-transformations of the solids correspond to automorphisms of their graphs?

- Should I write about the difference when only considering rotations and not allowing reflections?

- In Burnsides lemma, is it ok that the set X over which we take the actions can be infinite?
