# Meeting 24.3.2025

## Questions

- Do I have to provide argument why the 3d-transformations of the solids correspond to automorphisms of their graphs?

- Should I write about the difference when only considering rotations and not allowing reflections?

- In Burnsides lemma, is it ok that the set X over which we take the actions can be infinite?

## Updates

- added chapter that introduces Burnside's counting lemma (defined it for my particular case)
  - definitions: automorphism, group, orbit, stabilizer, fixpoint

- wrote a definition of the orbital chromatic polynomial

- writing proof of the formula for computing orbital chromatic polynomial of a graph using its automorphism group and chromatic polynomials of corresponding fixation graphs

- commented on the computation of usual chromatic polynomials
