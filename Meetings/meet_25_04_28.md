# Meeting 25.4.2025 

## Updates

- messaged Cameron if he knows a fast way to calculate the relabeling-automorphism classes

- tested if printing the poly coeffs in columns (by flipping axes) is good for chromatic polys

- added abstract and keywords (are they good?)
  - should I change them on sis page?

- added introduction

- next I would like to check for PDF/A compliance and abstract generation

## Questions

- are keywords and abstract okay?

- introduction okay?

- is red colored emphasis of numbers of relabeling-automorphism classes that we show as examples okay?

- what did he mean by "without grandmothering"?

## Notes

- program pro HPC s logem mezivysledku

- introduction
  - less content and more motivation
    - why we did what we did

- less drastic ending

- data structure for checking representants automorphic to certain colorings

## TODOs

- make vertices in the figures bigger (if can be done by sage)
