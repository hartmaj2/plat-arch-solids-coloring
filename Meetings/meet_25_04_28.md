# Meeting 25.4.2025 

## Updates

- messaged Cameron if he knows a fast way to calculate the relabeling-automorphism classes

- tested if printing the poly coeffs in columns (by flipping axes) is good for chromatic polys

- added abstract and keywords (are they good?)

## Questions

- should add image of Phosphorous to the introduction?

- are keywords and abstract okay?

- is red colored emphasis of numbers of relabeling-automorphism classes that we show as examples okay?

- what did he mean by "without grandmothering"?

## Notes

## TODOs
