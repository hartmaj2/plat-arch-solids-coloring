## Updates

- orbital chromatic polynomial:
- found out there exists a notion of chromatic polynomial which computes the number of equivalence classes of the colorings
  - [paper_resource](https://webspace.maths.qmul.ac.uk/p.j.cameron/csgnotes/countcols.pdf)
- manage to create and test my function to compute the orbital chromatic polynomial
  - [desmos_test](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lszdss0jv1)

- improved definitions (added labels) and improved tables to the correct format

- made the tables with chrompolys show only the relevant ones

- finished proof of the chromatic poly of complete k-partite graphs of partition size 2

## Questions

- Is the vrtex configuration explanation now better?
- Should I add an explanatory figure?

- Bachelor thesis: Do I have to notify Samal so I have "Schvaleni garantem"?
