# Meeting 17.3.2025

## Updates

- orbital chromatic polynomial:
- found out there exists a notion of chromatic polynomial which computes the number of equivalence classes of the colorings
  - [paper_resource](https://webspace.maths.qmul.ac.uk/p.j.cameron/csgnotes/countcols.pdf)
- manage to create and test my function to compute the orbital chromatic polynomial
  - [desmos_test](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lszdss0jv1)

- improved definitions (added labels) and improved tables to the correct format

- made the tables with chrompolys show only the relevant ones

- finished proof of the chromatic poly of complete k-partite graphs of partition size 2

## Questions

- Is the vrtex configuration explanation now better?
- Should I add an explanatory figure?

- Bachelor thesis: Do I have to notify Samal so I have "Schvaleni garantem"?

## Notes

- orbital chromatic polynomial od Camerona
  - pridat do prace zdrojak kodu a referenci na jeho praci
  - demonstrovat ten polynom take na konkretnim priklade (najit vhodne teleso s dobrym poctem obarveni)

- tried to find if somebody has already written about orbital chromatic polynomial of Platonic solids
  - didn't find anything

- how to think about clearness of my proofs
  - good when I can add a demonstrative figure

- thought about wheter we should contact Cameron for reference

## Todos

- [ ] dat si termin na odevzdavatelnou verzi prace (treba za 3 tydny)

- [ ] comment more on orbital chromatic polynomials
  - [ ] describe what they are
  - [ ] what technique is used to compute them
  - [ ] include source code in the appendix
  - [ ] add a figure that demonstrates the result coming from the polynomial on some special case with not too many colorings
