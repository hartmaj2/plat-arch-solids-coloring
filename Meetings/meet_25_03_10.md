# Meeting 10.3.2025

## Questions

- is there a way to systematically calculate all possible transformation of a solid and their fixpoint sizes (amount of cycles they have)?

- why for cube only 24 transformations mentioned?

- possible to get access to following book?
  - [link](https://academic.oup.com/book/54439)
  - contains summary of properties of Archimedean graphs

## Updates

- found that Sage can calculate the group of automorphisms of given graph

- read all of Polya.pdf

- printed # of automorphisms of all the Platonic solids

- zkusit redukovat problem na 8-mi/12-ti uhelnik

## Record

- mostly talked about how the problem will change when we restrict ourself to counting only proper coloring using Polya's theorem
  - found out that we can eliminate automorphisms that map vertices to their neighbors
    - reason: 
      - if a permutation stabilizes a coloring => all vertices on each cycle must have same color
      - if vertices connected by an edge => must have different color
      - if vertex is mapped to another vertex => they are in the same cycle & they are connected by an edge => must have same color and different color which is a contradiction
  - though about whether the resulting set of automorphisms after elimination will form a subgroup
    - we think that it will not because the set will not be closed under composition operation
