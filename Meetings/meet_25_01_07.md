# Meeting 17.12.2024

## Updates 

- What I described in the mail
  - Calculated chromatic numbers using SageMath
  - Wrote geometrical definitions of Platonic and Archimedean solids

## Questions

- Should I define the geometrical concepts even though I will later only work with graphs of these objects?
- Should I talk about the fact that all convex polyhedra have corresponding planar graphs?

- Next should I define and find out numbers for total colorings of the solids?
  - By transforming the graphs to different ones and then applying ordinary colorings on those graphs?

- Should I mention Steinitz theorem in the text?

- Maybe where to add pictures?
