# Meeting 3.3.2025

## Updates

- restructured the thesis chapters

- added many visualisations for the graph conversions

- calculation of edge chromatic using line graphs is faster than using the edge_coloring funciton

- managed to calculate the total chromatic number using the conversion we talked about last time

## Questions

- is the restructuring of the thesis I did good?

- should add the types of faces (n-gons) to the table with the basic properties?

- should write more about magic labeling?

- should also include chapter about how the geometric operations correspond to operations on the graphs?

- should add more coloring definitions?
  - perfect colorings where everything possible is colored

- compute other chromatic numbers?
  - face coloring
  - rainbow coloring

- what about the book: Coloring Problems?

- IMPORTANT: what should be my next main goal?
