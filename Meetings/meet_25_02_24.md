# Meeting 24.2.2025

## Updates

## Questions

- change color of specific elements for the following views?

- should try to calculate chrom nums nicer? (in terms of polys of K_n graphs)
  - why? - maybe there could be nice pattern due to symmetry, see: [this](../Resources/Handwritten/octahedron_chrom_poly_pascal.pdf)
  - possible to just try to divide the ugly polys with polys of K_i iteratively

- should add the chrom poly table to the thesis?

- in perfect colorings, can regions sharing same vertex have same color?
  - I think that yes, otherwise we could not use The Four Color Theorem on the region coloring

## Notes

- incidence graph
  - two partites: elements, sets
  - edge between partite if element contained in the set

- total coloring conversion
  - create incidence graph as follows:
    - partites: vertices, edges
    - edge between partites if vertex contains given edge
    - edge inside vertex partite if edge in original graph
    - edge inside edge partite if edge in line graph

## TODO

- definitions:
  - line graph
  - incidence graph
  - dual graph

- conversions of graphs and compute colorings from the converted graph
  - face colorings
  - total and perfect colorings
