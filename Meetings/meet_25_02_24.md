# Meeting 24.2.2025

## Updates

## Questions

- change color of specific elements for the following views?

- should try to calculate chrom nums nicer? (in terms of polys of K_n graphs)
  - possible to just try to divide the ugly polys with polys of K_i iteratively

- should add the chrom poly table to the thesis?

- in perfect colorings, can regions sharing same vertex have same color?
  - if no: why does $\chi^P \leq \chi'' + 4$?
  - if yes: why does he assign different numbers to the regions in friendship graph?
