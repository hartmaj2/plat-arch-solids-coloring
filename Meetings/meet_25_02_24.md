# Meeting 24.2.2025

## Updates

## Questions

- change color of specific elements for the following views?

- should try to calculate chrom nums nicer? (in terms of polys of K_n graphs)
  - possible to just try to divide the ugly polys with polys of K_i iteratively

- should add the chrom poly table to the thesis?

- what is the "Smarandachely Î›-coloring" from: [here](https://fs.unm.edu/IJMC/Graph_Coloring,Types_and_Applications_A_Survey.pdf)
    - why mapping colors to elements (how can one color be assigned to multiple element?)

- in perfect colorings, can regions sharing same vertex have same color?
  - if no: why does $\chi^P \leq \chi'' + 4$?
  - if yes: why does he assign different numbers to the regions in friendship graph?
