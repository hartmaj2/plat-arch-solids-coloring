# Meeting 17.12.2024

## Updates 

- created thesis template in english and written introduction

- went to National Library to take pictures of relevant sectinos of the Graph Coloring Problems book

- found a useful [link](https://polyhedra.tessera.li/) to visualize the operations on Archimedean solids

- found a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_graphs_by_edges_and_vertices) with list of coloring numbers of the Platonic and Archimedean graphs

- decided to make a Visual Graph Coloring Editor program for my credit project from C++

- researched about the operations which create Archimedean polyhedra from Platonic polyhedra
  - written down a list of these operations and how they apply on vertex configuration

## Questions

- should write thesis in Czech/English?

- does he have any better idea for a c++ program (should be week worth of work)
  - (original idea: create graph editor that allows me to apply and check different colorings)

- where to research to find what is state of the art?
  - (what I used so far: JSTOR, Wikipedia)

- does he know where to get the book: Coloring Problems so I can take it home also?

- where to find a list of know numbers outside of wikipedia?
  - then I could also add a reference to it to wikipedia page

- what to define
  - all the mentioned colorings
  - platonic and archimedean solids

- what to work
  - write definitions
  - find out what areas are undiscovered (total coloring, magic labeling, distance constrained)
  - finding interesting colorings
