\section{Computed selected chromatic numbers}

The vertex and edge chromatic numbers can be computed in little time using \textit{SageMath} functions \cite{sagemath-chromatic-number} \cite{sagemath-chromatic-index}. Since as of time of writing this thesis, there exists no function for directly computing the total chromatic number $\chi''(G)$, the conversion to total graph mentioned in chapter \ref{chap:clring_conversions} must be used. 

The following two tables provide overview of vertex, edge and total chromatic numbers, denoted by $\chi(G)$, $\chi'(G)$ and $\chi''(G)$ respectively, for Platonic and Archimedean solids. Note that the edge chromatic number $\chi'(G)$ is also called the \textit{chromatic index}.

\end{table}

Note, that from the tables above, we see that indeed all the above graphs have $\chi(G)$ at most 4. This is due to the famous \textit{Four Color Theorem} \cite{appelhaken76} for planar graphs.

\begin{highlight}

Another fact worth mentioning is that using the results of the \textit{Brook's theorem} \cite{brooks41}, we have that the only graph from the table above s.t. it has $\chi(G) = \Delta(G) + 1$ should be the tetrahedron which is indeed true by checking with tables \ref{tab:platonic-basic-props} and \ref{tab:archimedean-basic-props}. 

\end{highlight}

As a consequence of \textit{Vizing's theorem} \cite{misra92}, for every graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta(G)$, we have $\Delta(G) \leq \chi'(G) \leq \Delta(G) + 1$. This implies two classes of graphs. Class one are graphs s.t. $\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)$. Class two are then graphs s.t. $\chi'(G) = \Delta(G) + 1$. What class are graphs of Platonic and Archimedean solids?

Let us compare the degrees at each vertex of the solids as shown in tables \ref{tab:platonic-basic-props} and \ref{tab:archimedean-basic-props} with their calculated chromatic indices in the tables above. We can observe, that all the solids are of Vizing class one. Note that this is not the case for all planar graphs. In fact, there exist planar graphs with $\Delta(G)$ from 2 up to 5 such that they are class two.

Similarly, for total coloring, Vizing's conjecture \cite{vizing68} states, that for all graphs, we have $\Delta(G) + 1 \leq \chi''(G) \leq \Delta(G) + 2$. If the conjecture holds, then it again implies two classes of graphs. In the case of Platonic and Archimedean solids, it turns out, that all of them except the tetrahedron belong to class with $\chi''(G) = \Delta(G) + 1$.

\section{Computing chromatic polynomials}

\begin{highlight}

Chromatic polynomial of any graph $G=(V,E)$ can be calculated recursively using the following fact: When we fix two vertices $u$, $v$ s.t. $\{u,v\} \notin E$, we can split all colorings of $G$ into two disjoint groups. Let $d$ be the amount of colorings of $G$ in which $u$ and $v$ are colored by different color and let $s$ be the amount of colorings in which $u$ and $v$ are colored by same colors. Then the amount of all colorings $P(G,x) = d + s$. Let $G+\{u,v\}$ be graph $G$ s.t. its set of edges is $E \cup \{u,v\}$. Let $G \cdot \{u,v\}$ be the graph $G + \{u,v\}$ where the edge $\{u,v\}$ is contracted into a single vertex. Then we can see that $d = P(G + \{u,v\},x)$ and $s = P(G \cdot \{u,v\},x)$. This fact yields the following formula:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:chrom_poly_nonedge}
 P(G,x) = P(G + \{u,v\},x) + P(G \cdot \{u,v\},x) \tag{$P$}
\end{equation}

The formula above serves as the recursive case of our computation i.e. when the graph has some non-edge. In the other case, the base case, the graph has no non-edges and thus it is a complete graph $K_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then the chromatic polynomial is $P(K_n,x) = x \cdot (x-1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (x-n+1)$.

\end{highlight}

Consider this example: Given the graph of tetrahedron $K_4$ and $X$ the family of proper vertex colorings. The chromatic polynomial $P_{X}(K_4,x) = x \cdot (x-1) \cdot (x-2) \cdot (x-3)$. This can be seen if we label the vertices $v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4$ and imagine coloring them sequentially in the order of their labels. We have exactly $x$ colors left to use for the first vertex. With each other vertex, we have one less color available to use.
