# plat-arch-solids-coloring
This is a repository for a bachelor thesis on the topic: **Coloring of Platonic and Archimedean solids**.

The repository is divided into multiple files:

## Code

Contains all code that was used for computing results stated in the thesis. There is also code for automatization of loading the solid information from corresponding json files of the solids. These source files are located in the `JsonGraphs` folder.

I would like to kindly thank **[Nat Alison](https://www.tessera.li/)**, the creator of **[Polyhedra viewer](https://polyhedra.tessera.li/)**, as that is the place from which I extracted the jsons.

Lastly you can also find code for automatization of data printing to latex or md tables as I needed to perform these operations repeatedly.

## Meetings

This folder contains notes from my weekly consultations with my supervisior **[Jiri Fiala](https://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~fiala/index.shtml.en)**, who I would also like to give many thanks.

## Notes

Contains less structured notes considering my work on the thesis. Most useful are the notes `diary.md` and `todo.md` as these can be used to track how the work evolved throughout time. If you are curious about how much time and effort the creation of this thesis took me, make sure to look inside.

## Paper

Here dwells the actual bachelor thesis and all its tex files. I used `Overleaf` to typeset it.

## Resources

The `Figs` folder contains all figures and images used throughout the thesis.

Inside `Handwritten`, you can find a selection of handwritten notes that I thought were worth sharing with the world or keeping aside.
